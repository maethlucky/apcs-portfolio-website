      <p>This is the game I made for the AP Computer Science summer homework. In it, you control a bat and dodge deadly lasers. I had a lot of fun making this game, and it’s definitely the most complicated thing I’ve ever done on Scratch.</p>

      <p>This screenshot is the result of a drawing program that I made on Snap during my free time. You  can give the command the number of sides for a shape, the length of the sides, the number of rotations around the center, the pen size, and whether or not you want color, and it will create a geometric shape by spinning a shape of your choice around the center.</p>

      <p>This screenshot is the start screen of an app that we made for the Congressional App Challenge. We didn't win, but it was a fun experience, and I'm very proud of how the game turned out.</p>

      <p>This is a Python project I made while I was in a cyber security camp. It is a simple program that encodes and decodes messages in Base64. Even though it is not that complicated, I’m still very proud of it because it was basically the first thing I ever made by myself in Python.</p>
